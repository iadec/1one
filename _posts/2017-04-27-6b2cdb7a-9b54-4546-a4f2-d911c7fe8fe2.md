[Snapwidget][0] is a very popular way to add an Instagram gallery to your site. Similar to Instush they have a number of free galleries that you can easily set up, and they will then provide you with the embed code.

The problem with this app, is if you click on the photo, rather than going to an Instagram page, you are sent to a very badly designed page on snapwidget dot com. For the app to redirect you to your Instagram page, you must be using a Pro template, which ranges between $5 - 7$ per month! Thats almost the same yearly cost as thegrid.io. So whilst it is a great widget, the cost is too much for a personal 'blog'...
